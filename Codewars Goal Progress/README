Codewars Progress Tracker

A personal progress tracker for my Codewars journey.
This project helps me visualize how far Ive come, keep track of points earned, and log when I solved a kata.

â¸»

Features:
- Dynamic progress bar that will update with my solved kata count.
- Manual input or automated updates (future: Codewars API integration...Maybe).
- Database storage to log kata completions with date/time.
- Frontend UI built with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive design.
- Backend logic in Python & JavaScript to handle calculations.

--------------------

How it will work:
    1.Ill input the number of points Ive earned.
    2.The tracker updates:
        - Progress percentage (solved vs. total target).
        - Visual progress bar.
        - History log entry in the database.
    3.Everything will stay synced so I can see long-term progress.
